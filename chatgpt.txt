How to reduce dependence on a web development infrastructure?

Answer from ChatGPT
To reduce dependence on a web development infrastructure, you can follow these steps:

Use version control: Use a version control system like Git to manage your source code. This will help you keep track of changes and collaborate with other developers without being dependent on a specific development environment.

Use cloud-based development tools: Use cloud-based development tools like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket to host your code and collaborate with other developers. These tools offer web-based interfaces that can be accessed from any device with an internet connection.

Use containerization: Use containerization technologies like Docker to create an isolated environment for your application. This will make your application more portable and independent of the underlying infrastructure.

Use serverless computing: Use serverless computing technologies like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions to run your application without the need for a dedicated server. This will reduce your dependence on a specific infrastructure and allow you to scale your application more easily.

Use third-party APIs: Instead of building everything from scratch, use third-party APIs to add functionality to your application. This will reduce your dependence on a specific infrastructure and allow you to focus on building your application's core functionality.
